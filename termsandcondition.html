                    <h1 class="mb-2">Terms of Service</h1>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                        The following are the terms and conditions that will govern the agreement between Ridera
                        Technologies Limited hereinafter called “the company or Ridera” and “The User” hereinafter the
                        called “client or customer”. <br>


                    <h4> GENERAL</h4>
                    Although the company endeavours to reasonably protect and secure all items fragile or otherwise,
                    the onus lies with the client to ensure that, loose and/or fragile pieces for example china,
                    sensitive electronics, etc. are properly packed, padded and labeled accordingly, prior to our
                    handling. (We highly recommend using our packing and pre-move services which include wrapping,
                    packing, etc., to avoid possible overtime charges and ensure optimum protection of items).

                    <br><br>

                    <h6> Client’s Responsibility:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To properly prepare for pending relocation (i.e. all small pieces etc., should be cleared
                            from
                            surfaces, properly packed in boxes or bins and fragile pieces properly padded labeled and
                            secured).</li>

                        <li> To pay all fees and charges as required.</li>
                        <li> To properly protect and secure valuables and important documents and personally carry these
                            items if possible (The Company is not responsible for valuables not properly secured by
                            client).</li>

                        <li>To reasonably protect items that can be easily soiled (if our services are not required to
                            do
                            so) as the company is not responsible for incidental soiling to items reasonably handled by
                            movers.</li>
                        <li>To inspect back of truck upon completion of job, and confirm that all pertinent items have
                            offloaded.</li>
                        <li>To inform office of any special items (pianos, safes etc) or any special requirements that
                            may
                            have an
                            impact on the handling of such items. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br />
                    <h6>CLAIMS
                        Compensation</h6>

                    <p>The company undertakes to repair, replace or reimburse clients in the event of any damage(s) to
                        his/her property due to negligence (i.e. reasonable care and skill was not exercised in the
                        handling of customer’s possessions. Client is required to prove negligence) on the part of the
                        company’s representatives as follows:-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The value of reimbursement is based on resale value of the item at the time of damage (age,
                            condition and type of item being taken into account). Value of the item will be depreciated
                            per
                            relevant depreciation principles or by mutual agreement.</li>

                        <li>If an item is part of a set, then only the individual item will be addressed. If the
                            individual item cannot be located locally, then the closest local substitute will be used.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Item may be taken off site and repaired: company reserves the right however to choose
                            repairer. If the
                            client refuses to allow the item to be taken for repair, then ay claim in relation to said
                            item
                            will be dismissed.</li>

                        <li>A mutually agreed discount on invoice. Furthermore, any discount previously negotiated will be
                        taken into account when determining compensation (if any).</li>
                        <li>Company may replace item if the item is irreparable. Compensation however, will be
                        commensurate with damage and cost of restitution.</li>

                        <li>Customer is required to pay all fees where applicable should a false claim be made and the
                        company incurs costs pursuant to investigation of such claim. This includes service personnel
                        visits, polygraph testing of employees, etc.</li>

                        <li>Any claims must be reported to the company within 48 hours.</li>

                    </ul><br />

                    and/or defect.</p>

                    <li>If client insists on us wrapping, packing or stacking furniture or items in a way which we
                    consider to be inimical to the safety of that item and others and this fact is relayed to the

                    charges being applied and the rate applicable is dependent on overdraft interest charges
                    prevailing at the time of default.</li>
                    <li>In event of a claim, all payments must be settled before claim can be dealt with.</li>
                    <li>Deviation from any of the foregoing requires expressed permission from a named member of
                    management.</li>

                   <li> Overtime and Miscellaneous Charges Unless otherwise stated, cost given for move is on a per trip basis
                    When there is case where the actual items to be moved is more than the item items listed.
                    Extra charges would be incurred based on weight, volume and value of the item. The extra cost
                    will determined by Ridera.</li>
